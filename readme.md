# Way-Better
  This app was built with increasing interest in public transportation in mind. There has been a 62% increase in traffic congestion in the last 5 years in the Bay Area. This app helps people automatically record how much they are saving over time taking public transport or walking/biking vs. rideshare as an inspiration to keep doing so.
  
  The current app was done with a team of 5 in the Hacking With Hearth Hackathon, and is very incomplete.
