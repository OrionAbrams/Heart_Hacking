# Way Better

## Live Site: [Way Better](https://waybetter.herokuapp.com/) 
  * Note: The current app was done with a team of 5 in the SF Hacking With Heart Hackathon, and is very incomplete.

## Design: To be uploaded

### 1. Why / Background
  *  Way Better was built with increasing interest in public transportation in mind. There has been a 62% increase in traffic congestion in the last 5 years in the Bay Area. This app helps people automatically record how much they are saving over time taking public transport or walking/biking vs. rideshare as an inspiration to keep doing so

 ### 2. What / Objectives / User Stories
  * **Technologies**, design through deployment of the application:
    * Server-side: Node.js w/ Express web app framework; MongoDB for data persistence
    * Client-side: React.js library for component based user interface; Material Bootstrap framework for HTML/CSS
  * **User stories**:
    * To be able to gain motivation to take more public transport and help the environment and traffic congestion in the process
    * To gain points and possible rewards in taking public transport more, with game-like elements so it's fun.
